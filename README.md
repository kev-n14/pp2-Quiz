### **Features Left to Implement**
In the future we hope to add:
* When a user answers and question and comes back to the question their answer is still selected.
* Images to the questions.
* Random question selected. So the quiz is different each time.
* Indicate to the user if the answer is correct or incorrect.
* A reveal below question explaining to the user why the answer is correct.
